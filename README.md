## Setup

1. Install Python 3.6 or later.

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install instagrapi python-dotenv
    ```

3. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Louvivien/letthemlive.git
    cd letthemlive
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Instagram username and password:

    ```bash
    INSTA_USERNAME=your_username
    INSTA_PASSWORD=your_password
    ```

5. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

This script logs into Instagram using the provided username and password, finds a user by their username, and sends them a direct message. It uses AutoGPT and LangChain to automate the conversation with the user.

## Troubleshooting

If the script is not working as expected, check the following:

- Make sure your Instagram username and password are correct and the account is not locked or restricted.
- Check the console for any error messages.

## Ongoing work

The integration of AutoGPT, LangChain, and Instagram is complete. It can engage in a conversation, follow user based on a topic. 
We will add some other methods in instagram and add other social media. 

Currently adding method to generate images with DeamBooth model and Replicate.
